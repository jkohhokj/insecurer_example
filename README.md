# Description

This is one of the dummy machines created for BWSI's Embedded Security and Hardware Hacking that emulated an insecure firmware updater. This was part of the A/D CTF final project for the course where students had to hack into other team's systems.

This example uses bit shifting and an insecure implementation of the AES nonce/IV as part of the encryption scheme.
